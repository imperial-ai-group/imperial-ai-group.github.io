# Workflow: Contributing and Deploying Changes

This website is deployed directly from the `main` branch. **Important: To ensure stability, never commit directly to the `main` branch!**  All changes should be made via pull requests.  Follow the workflow below:

1.  **Create a New Branch:**

    *   From your local repository (or via the GitHub website), create a new branch for your changes.  Name it descriptively, e.g., `feature/new-event-page`, `fix/typo-on-homepage`, `update/team-member-profile`.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
    ```

2.  **Make Your Updates:**

    *   **Page Templates:** All page templates are located in the `templates/` directory.
    *   **Content Creation:** Utilize these templates to generate markup. One can use AI code generation tools and/or agents to generate the markup using your own content and media.

3. **Commit Your Changes and Push Your Branch**

4.  **Create a Pull Request**

5.  **Merge to `main`**
